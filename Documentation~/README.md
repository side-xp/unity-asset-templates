# Asset Templates

Utility for creating text assets from user-defined templates, whether they are scripts, data or any kind of serialized object.

You can create those assets based on templates from a menu, or automate their use by name pattern or target folder.

## Features

- Define template files for assets
- Trigger script generation as template
- Use template by name pattern (eg. add a suffix `-Component` to generate a component script)
- Use template by folder location
- Declare and set options for all the templates in your project
