# Asset Templates

Utility for creating text assets from user-defined templates, whether they are scripts, data or any kind of serialized object.

All from a single menu: `Assets (or right-click in Project view) > Create > Create Asset From Template`

## Features

- Define template files for assets
- Trigger script generation as template
- Use template by name pattern (eg. add a suffix `-Component` to generate a component script)
- Use template by folder location
- Declare and set options for all the templates in your project

[=> See the built-in templates](./built-in-templates.md)

## Examples

Create components with utility attributes, and handle inheritance if applicable:

Create scriptable objects with utility attributes:
